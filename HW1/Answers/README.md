LaTeX is a typesetting engine. Unlike Word, which is controlled by mouse, various menus and buttons, LaTeX uses text commands to define the way your document is typeset. These commands look a bit like a programming language.

I use overleaf.com for writing in LaTeX since I can easily share the project with someone and be able to work on it at the same time.
For running this solution, the following actions should be done:
Create a new project on the OverLife Site;
Upload all files except the “commons” folder in your project;
Create new folder in your project and name it “commons”;
Upload all files of the “commons” folder to your “commons” folder;
To write in Persian Language, it is necessary to change these items in the menu section;
